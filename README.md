# Intellij language injections for styled components

*N.B. Official plugin now exists: https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/9997-styled-components so I reccomend using that now instead :) *

This language injection configuration file gives IntelliJ based products (webstorm/pycharm/phpstorm,etc) some knowledge of styled-components, providing syntax highlighting and hints.

Tested in 2017.1 and 2017.2

## Installation
- File->Settings
- Language Injections
- Import
- 'styled-components.xml'



## Where this helps


- Rule 1 - Catches any literal within `styled(...)` or `styled.anything(...)`

```
jsLiteralExpression().and(jsArgument("styled", 0))
```


- Rule 2 - Catches any literal after an expression starting with ``styled`...` `` including ``styled.span`...` `` and ``styled.anything`...` ``

```
jsLiteralExpression().withParent(psiElement().withText(string().startsWith("styled")))
```


- Rule 3 - Fallback case that matches any literal who's variable name starts with `Styled` as in 

```const StyledCoolComponent = whatever`...` ```

```
jsLiteralExpression().withParent(psiElement().withParent(psiElement().withText(string().startsWith("Styled"))))
```

This last rule is obviously quite workflow specific. I've left it in here in case it helps anyone else.


## TODO:

- Add a rule to catch ``StyledComponent.extend`...` `` 
(the work around at the moment for me is via rule 3)

- Other API usage

## Known issues

- JS interpolations - The correct highlighting of them is unlikely to ever be possible via this language injection method. Judging from from their 'PSI Viewer' the editor can't peek inside the template string itself to reason about what type of language tokens may or may not be there (at least, not via this language injection interface).
